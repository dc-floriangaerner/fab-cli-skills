# Fab Deploy

## Use

Use this skill when the task is to promote Fabric items between environments with `fab`. It is optimized for export or import flows, overwrite decisions, path validation, and post-deploy verification.

Read [references/deploy-patterns.md](references/deploy-patterns.md) when the deployment spans multiple items or needs a repeatable promotion plan. Use [scripts/render_manifest.py](scripts/render_manifest.py) when the user wants a manifest-driven command list.

Point users to [assets/deploy-manifest.sample.json](assets/deploy-manifest.sample.json) when they need a starting template.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the source workspace or item path and the destination path.
2. Inspect the source and destination with `fab dir`, `fab get`, `fab exists`, or `fab desc` before changing anything.
3. If the deployment needs a new Lakehouse that will host Spark schemas such as `bronze`, `silver`, or `gold`, create it with `-P enableSchemas=true` instead of relying on the default.
4. Ensure the local staging or verification directory exists before any `fab export` step. In some environments export fails with `InvalidPath` if the output folder is missing.
5. Export or identify the local artifact to deploy.
6. Import with `--force` only when the intended overwrite behavior is explicit.
7. Re-check the destination after import and summarize what changed.

## Commands

Check whether an item exists before import:

```powershell
fab exists "target-ws.Workspace/item.Notebook"
```

Export an item to a local directory:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path ".\staging" | Out-Null
fab export "source-ws.Workspace/item.Notebook" -o ".\\staging" -f
```

Import an item into a workspace:

```powershell
fab import "target-ws.Workspace/item.Notebook" -i ".\\staging\\item.Notebook"
```

Create a Lakehouse with schema support enabled:

```powershell
fab create "target-ws.Workspace/lh_bronze.Lakehouse" -P enableSchemas=true
```

Force an update only after confirming intent:

```powershell
fab import "target-ws.Workspace/item.Notebook" -i ".\\staging\\item.Notebook" -f
```

Render commands from a deployment manifest:

```powershell
python scripts/render_manifest.py .\deploy-manifest.json
```

## Safety Rules

- Do not overwrite an existing destination silently. Check first, then state whether the import will create or replace.
- If the user did not specify the source item type or destination path clearly, discover it with `fab dir` rather than guessing.
- Prefer reversible operations using local export folders before destructive updates.
- If a deployment involves multiple items, keep a clear per-item summary.
- In non-interactive automation, prefer `fab import -f` when an import would otherwise prompt.
- If you must provision a Lakehouse as part of the deployment and downstream notebooks use `saveAsTable("<schema>.<table>")`, create the Lakehouse with `enableSchemas=true`.
- Some `fab import` operations may complete successfully even when the terminal host times out before the final success line is printed. Always verify the destination with `fab exists`, `fab dir`, or `fab api` after long-running imports.
- When a deployment creates downstream dependencies such as pipelines that reference notebook IDs, treat same-workspace overwrite and cross-workspace promotion differently.
- For same-workspace overwrite, item identity often stays stable, but still verify the deployed pipeline definition rather than assuming it.
- For cross-workspace promotion, re-discover the imported item IDs after import instead of assuming the IDs from another workspace or an earlier run.
- Treat same-workspace folder reorganization as a separate risk area. `fab` may not support moving items across folders within the same workspace reliably.
- If `fab get` or `fab desc` are not giving useful item-definition detail in the current shell host, verify by exporting the deployed item to a local folder and inspect the exported files directly.

## Reporting Style

- Prefer rich Markdown presentation over plain prose when reporting deployment plans, execution, or verification.
- Start with a short status line that uses clear icons such as `OK`, `WARN`, `FAIL`, or `INFO`.
- Use compact tables for source, destination, item type, overwrite mode, command status, and verification result.
- Separate the response into short sections such as `Plan`, `Execution`, `Verification`, and `Follow-up`.
- Use fenced code blocks only for exact commands or manifest fragments the user may reuse.
- Use simple diagrams only when a multi-environment promotion path benefits from a visual.
- Keep the deployment summary crisp and operational rather than narrative-heavy.

## Output

- Show the exact `fab` commands used or proposed.
- State the source, destination, overwrite behavior, and verification result in a compact visual structure.
- If you had to infer paths or item types, say so explicitly.
- If verification relied on `fab api` because the first-class command surface was flaky, say that explicitly.
- If verification relied on `fab export` because `fab get` or `fab desc` were not usable for item-definition inspection, say that explicitly.
