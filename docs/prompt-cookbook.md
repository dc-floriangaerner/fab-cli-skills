## Before You Start

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">
      <h3>Codex</h3>
      <p>Use <code>$skill-name</code>.</p>
      <p>Example: <code>$fab-job-ops</code></p>
    </td>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">
      <h3>GitHub Copilot</h3>
      <p>Use <code>/skill-name</code>.</p>
      <p>Example: <code>/fab-job-ops</code></p>
    </td>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">
      <h3>Always Replace</h3>
      <p>Swap in your own workspace names, item names, table names, and paths before running anything.</p>

> A strong Fabric prompt usually names the skill, the exact path or workspace, the desired action, and any safety rule like "dry run first" or "do not execute yet."

### Review a Fabric semantic model before making changes

Codex:

```text
Use $fab-semantic-model to connect to the semantic model Sales Analytics in workspace Analytics Dev through the Power BI Modeling MCP Server, assess star schema quality, naming, measures, folders, and descriptions, and separate safe direct fixes from risky recommendations before changing anything.
```

```text
Use the /fab-semantic-model skill to connect to the semantic model Sales Analytics in workspace Analytics Dev through the Power BI Modeling MCP Server, assess star schema quality, naming, measures, folders, and descriptions, and separate safe direct fixes from risky recommendations before changing anything.
```

## Jobs

### Inspect recent pipeline runs

## Simple Rules That Help

- Start with discovery if you are unsure about a path or item.
- Ask for a dry run before copy, move, delete, import, or ACL changes.
- For API work, inspect one raw response before writing a query.
- For job work, look at recent runs before restarting workloads.
